 Javascript pasword generator Prject
This project was an introduction to JavaScript. It also depicts a basic use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript at play or working together. There is an importance in being able to make the three languages communicate with one another and this was a practice in fine-tuning that understanding. 
I am very much a visual learner and I gathered my material for this project from class lectures, reading material but I would say more importantly from what I learned in group work and then also from what I learned watching oh YouTube video. That was particularly helpful to me putting all of those parts together and all of those areas of study and it really helped me to understand how to get this project to come together and to get the pieces of the puzzle to connect. The scenario here is that if you were an employer who wanted to provide their employees with a strong password generator that you could give them a generator that held up to a list of specific criteria and guidelines that we were provided with. 
I feel that maybe mine could still use a little bit of fine-tuning but I feel overall sense of accomplishment and more than anything I found myself fiddling around with style at the end. But I at least felt like I understood the concepts and so I’ve I felt good about that. The generator that I have come up with is fairly basic and straightforward I’m pretty new to coding and I didn’t wanna try to reinvent the wheel I was just trying to mostly stick with let’s make a password generator and if I had time I would try to do more with it. Overall though this was a great first experience with JavaScript and I particularly enjoyed this week of learning and I could see a very applicable correlation to why it would be so useful in so many areas of application and I appreciate that it builds on what we’ve learned so far and then with what I’m starting to understand about APIs there’s this continual flow of connection. And I can see why it’s so important to have each of them you can you need to have A good understanding of HTML to be successful with CSS and really CSS is so important HTML to give it style and it just takes a project that you could do for not to have an understanding of but aspects and abilities css has. And then you take it a step further with JavaScript and then seeing the way that those three languages can work with each other it seemed a little bit overwhelming at first but that was when we were doing the pre-work and now that I’ve had a couple weeks JavaScript seems amazing. It seems so advanced compared to CSS and HTML but there’s a beauty to CSS the weekend add personality and express. But then with APIs I feel blown away by the way that API’s put it all together and tied up with a bow. I’m really excited to see what else there is but I feel like even if this was all that I ever learned in coding who came to so much just by seeing what can be offered with just HTMLCSS and JavaScript. This project may seem simple but it takes what would be potentially difficult in one moment for a person to determined and one split second and gives them a readily available solution. And it gives you options you get to choose do you want to have a specific length or use symbols numbers uppercase lowercase. To some degree you get to make the decisions and then you were givin A helpful Tool. A generator that can determine a safe password something devoid of personal or easy to guess names numbers birthdays.

This project was an introduction to JavaScript it also depicts a basic use of HTML CSS and JavaScript at play or working together. There is a importance in being able to make the three languages communicate with one another and this was a practice in fine-tuning that understanding. 
If I had more time and maybe over the next week or two I think what I would like to do is go back and maybe I would add a little bit more style to the page and I would also maybe put some suggestions probably in the form of prompts or just in a list at the bottom to the viewer. 
this may include a link to how often they should change their password for safety if you think about personal banking or identity theft I would probably suggest at least every 90 days and we forget to do that so maybe another cool project that you could put in a bundle with this is just even a timer or tell people to on their calendar set a reminder that every 90 days they need to go through and update their passwords. and then in addition on that list I would probably also include a spreadsheet that I had made for myself just a downloadable link or just throw it in the HTML or something like that but I would include a link for an easy way for people to track passwords that they can keep in one Drive or dropbox or Google docs or Google drive so that sure do you have this password generator but really what good is it when you change your password and you can’t remember a bunch of letters 
and symbols. I do that all the time so I try to keep track of mine by keeping a list in an Excel sheet and I know there’s ways that you can lock those but maybe would be helpful to just in that password generator just to provide tips to utilizing this password generator to its fullest. 


Acceptance Criteria GIVEN I need a new, secure password 

WHEN I click the button to generate a password
 THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria 

WHEN prompted for password criteria 
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
 
WHEN prompted for the length of the password 
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters 

WHEN asked for character types to include in the password 
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters 

WHEN I answer each prompt 
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected WHEN all prompts are answered 

THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria WHEN the password is generated 

THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
